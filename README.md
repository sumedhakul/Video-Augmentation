# Video-Augmentation
In this project, we embarked on a journey to harness the power of Python for multimedia data processing. Initially, we utilized an SRT (SubRip Subtitle) file to generate a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) dataset. This CSV file contained crucial geospatial data, specifically longitude and latitude coordinates. With this data in hand, we then computed the speed of movement between consecutive data points. Building upon this foundation, the project culminated in a video augmentation process, where the calculated speed and other relevant information were overlayed onto the original video. This not only enhanced the visual appeal but also provided viewers with real-time insights into the speed dynamics throughout the video.
